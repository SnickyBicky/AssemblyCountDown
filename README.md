<br>Assembly program that asks the user about number, takes it in decimal number as input and then outputs the entered value followed by a count down. It uses 2 loops, poslop when the given number is positive (thus it will need to be decreased till it reaches 0), and negloop when the given number is negative (increments until 0).
